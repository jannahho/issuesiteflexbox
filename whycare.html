<h1>Why Care?</h1>
<br>
<h8 class="quote">“When I was a kid, I felt so alone when people told me I was a wet blanket for caring so much about all the ‘little’ things. They made me feel like I was the crazy one for calling out their microaggressions. So even if just one person understands a bit more that these things aren’t little….”</h8>
<br><br>
<p2 class="quote">“People have called me ‘chink’, made fun of my eyes, or even just called the foreign music I like weird. It all just made me feel like I don’t belong in these spaces, in school, anywhere. It's perpetrated by my peers, and they don’t even see the harm behind these racist comments and jokes. They just think they’re funny things to say, which is part of the problem.” </p2>

<h2 class="quote">“It doesn’t bother me too much that my mom is restricting my outings since I don’t leave the house too much because of Covid anyway, but it’s more seeing this fear in my mom that gets to me.”</h2>
<p3 class="text">Everyday anxiety in all the little parts of our day is what makes this conversation necessary. Afterall, discrimination is not something that just lives in the news articles or in a political debate. It starts and lives at the elementary school lunch tables when you’re packed seaweed stew instead of a PB&J, and the other kids don’t want to sit near you because of the smell. It lives on the streets of a middle class town that promises its residents comfort, but you feel none at all as a pedestrian yells “fucking chink” at you while you’re stopped at the light with no clue as to what you’ve done to receive such a remark. And it certainly lives in the fear we see in our mothers’ eyes as they tell us to be careful when going out for a stroll in the neighborhood.</p3>

<h3 class="quote"> “Honestly, I’m sort of numb and unphased by the news at this point. My first reaction to hearing Trump call the virus “Kung Flu” was mostly just an eye roll. But the thing is, I know I wasn't feeling the weight of this, along with the other incidents of hate, as much as I should have. I’m angry that I’m not more angry.”</h3>
<p4 class="text">As the Covid-19 epidemic hit the U.S., anti-Asian hate crimes rose by 149% in 2020 (Center for Study of Hate & Extremism reports in their Anti‐Asian Prejudice Fact Sheet), a new spotlight was on Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) discrimination. Social media platforms flooded with support.
While it’s great that the discussion of discrimination is being taken seriously and getting coverage, social media can create the false illusion that these issues live and die on the timeline. AAPI hate has existed before just this past year’s reports of murders and will continue to exist after it loses its moment in the spotlight.

<h4 class="quote">Jackie Liu, 17 year old TikToker with over 1.1 million following states in a post:<br>“There was this whole societal ‘moment’ because suddenly lots of white people discovered structural racism and decided to read White Fragility by Robin Diangelo, so I feel like these major racial reckonings only happen when white people decide to pay attention. And that in itself is a reflection of the power dynamics that are at the very root of the problem. Don’t get me wrong- it’s definitely a good thing that this activism and awareness is happening. But I just hope we stop to reflect and ask “why now?” and push ourselves to call out injustice all the time, not just when it's trending.”</h4>

<h5 class="quote">“Social media isn’t perfect, but it is one step toward the right direction. It sucks that it took so many deaths and a whole pandemic to get attention for something that has existed since forever, but now that we do have it, it’s giving a lot of us a voice to speak out, when we’ve been told to shut up for so long.”</h5>
<p5 class="text">Discrimination is engrained into our daily lives and the hate doesn’t look so bad when it isn’t in the form of bloodshed. But it is, and it should be relevant all the time. </p5>
